# Invoice Manager
 
 ## Features
This app is fairly simple on the surface, but actually quite complicated. 

It is a simple invoice manager, the users create an account, enter in an amount, in dollars, the invoice is worth, 
the month it was created in and who created it, the user. The users can only see the invoices they create, and can only
edit or work on them.

The pre-seeded Manager account can then see all invoices and go through to either approve the invoice or reject it. 
The Manager account cannot edit the user invoices in any way.

Finally, there is a final Admin account which can do essentially everything, from creating and editing others invoices to 
approving and rejecting.

Lastly, all the invoices are displayed on the front page graph, viewable only by the Admin.

Overall, it is fairly simple, but still also quite complicated
